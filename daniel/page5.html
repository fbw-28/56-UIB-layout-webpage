        <p>I used to be an engineer, focused upon technical requirements, quite ignorant of people. Even after I
            switched into psychology and cognitive science, I still maintained my engineering emphasis upon logic and
            mechanism. It took a long time for me to realize that my understanding of human behavior was relevant to my
            in- terest in the design of technology. As I watched people struggle with technology, it became clear that
            the difficulties were caused by the technology, not the people. I was called upon to help analyze the
            American nuclear power plant accident at Three Mile Island (the island name comes from the fact that it is
            located on a river, three miles south of Middle- town in the state of Pennsylvania). In this incident, a
            rather simple mechanical failure was misdiagnosed. This led to several days of difficulties and confusion,
            total destruction of the reactor, and a very close call to a severe radiation release, all of which brought
            the American nuclear power industry to a complete halt. The op- erators were blamed for these failures:
            “human error” was the im- mediate analysis. But the committee I was on discovered that the plant’s control
            rooms were so poorly designed that error was inevi- table: design was at fault, not the operators. The moral
            was simple: we were designing things for people, so we needed to understand both technology and people. But
            that’s a difficult step for many engineers: machines are so logical, so orderly. If we didn’t have people,
            everything would work so much better. Yup, that’s how I used to think.
