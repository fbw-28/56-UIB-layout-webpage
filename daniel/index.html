        <h1>THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS</h1>

        <p id="start">If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability to perform well would
            neither surprise
            nor
            bother me. But why should I have trouble with doors and light switches, water faucets and stoves?
            <strong>“Doors?”</strong> I
            can
            hear the reader saying. <strong>“You have trouble opening doors?”</strong> Yes. I push doors that are meant
            to be
            pulled,
            pull
            doors that should be pushed, and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but slide. Moreover, I see
            others
            having the same troubles—unnecessary troubles. My problems with doors have become so well known that
            confusing
            doors are often called <strong>“Norman doors.”</strong> Imagine becoming famous for doors that don’t work
            right. I’m
            pretty
            sure
            that’s not what my parents planned for me. (Put <strong>“Norman doors”</strong> into your favorite search
            engine—be
            sure to
            include the quote marks: it makes for fascinating reading.) How can such a simple thing as a door be so
            confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to a
            door:
            you can open it or shut it. Suppose you are in an office building, walking down a corridor. You come to a
            door.
            How does it open? Should you push or pull, on the left or the right? Maybe the door slides. If so, in which
            direction? I have seen doors that slide to the left, to the right, and even up into the ceiling.
