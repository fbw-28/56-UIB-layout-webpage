            with a bewildering array of controls and displays, we simply mem- orize
            one or two fixed settings to approximate what is desired. In England I
            visited a home with a fancy new Italian washer- dryer combination, with
            super-duper multisymbol controls, all to do everything anyone could
            imagine doing with the washing and drying of clothes. The husband (an
            engineering psychologist) said he refused to go near it. The wife (a
            physician) said she had simply memorized one setting and tried to ignore
            the rest. I asked to see the manual: it was just as confusing as the
            device. The whole pur- pose of the design is lost.

        <h2>The Complexity of Modern Devices</h2>

        <p>
            All artificial things are designed. Whether it is the layout of fur-
            niture in a room, the paths through a garden or forest, or the in-
            tricacies of an electronic device, some person or group of people had to
            decide upon the layout, operation, and mechanisms. Not all designed
            things involve physical structures. Services, lectures, rules and
            procedures, and the organizational structures of busi- nesses and
            governments do not have physical mechanisms, but their rules of
            operation have to be designed, sometimes informally, sometimes precisely
            recorded and specified. But even though people have designed things
            since prehistoric times, the field of design is relatively new, divided
            into many areas of specialty. Because everything is designed, the number
            of areas is enormous, ranging from clothes and furniture to complex
            control rooms and bridges. This book covers everyday things, focusing on
            the interplay between technology and people to ensure that the products
            actually fulfill human needs while being understand- able and usable. In
            the best of cases, the products should also be delightful and enjoyable,
            which means that not only must the re- quirements of engineering,
            manufacturing, and ergonomics be sat- isfied, but attention must be paid
            to the entire experience, which means the aesthetics of form and the
            quality of interaction. The major areas of design relevant to this book
            are industrial design, interaction design, and experience design. None
            of the fields is well defined, but the focus of the efforts does vary,
            with industrial

            designers emphasizing form and material, interactive designers
            emphasizing understandability and usability, and experience de- signers
            emphasizing the emotional impact. Thus:

        <p>
            Industrial design: The professional service of creating and developing
            concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and
            appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user
            and manufacturer (from the Industrial Design Society of America’s
            website).
        </p>

        <p>
            Interaction design: The focus is upon how people interact with tech-
            nology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be
            done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction de-
            sign draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to
            ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Experience design: The practice of designing products, processes, ser-
            vices, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and
            enjoyment of the total experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Design is concerned with how things work, how they are con- trolled, and
            the nature of the interaction between people and technology. When done
            well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly,
            the products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation.
            Or they might be usable, but force us to behave the way the product
            wishes rather than as we wish. Machines, after all, are conceived,
            designed, and constructed by people. By human standards, machines are
            pretty limited. They do not maintain the same kind of rich history of
            experiences that people have in common with one another, experiences
            that enable us to interact with others because of this shared
            understanding. Instead, machines usually follow rather simple, rigid
            rules of be- havior. If we get the rules wrong even slightly, the
            machine does what it is told, no matter how insensible and illogical.
            People are imaginative and creative, filled with common sense; that is,
            a lot of valuable knowledge built up over years of experience. But
            instead of capitalizing on these strengths, machines require us to be
            precise and accurate, things we are not very good at. Machines have no
