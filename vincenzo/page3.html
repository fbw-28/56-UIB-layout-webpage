                All artificial things are designed. Whether it is the layout of fur- niture in a room, the paths through
                a
                garden or forest, or the in- tricacies of an electronic device, some person or group of people had to
                decide
                upon the layout, operation, and mechanisms. Not all designed things involve physical structures.
                Services,
                lectures, rules and procedures, and the organizational structures of busi- nesses and governments do not
                have physical mechanisms, but their rules of operation have to be designed, sometimes informally,
                sometimes
                precisely recorded and specified.
                But even though people have designed things since prehistoric times, the field of design is relatively
                new,
                divided into many areas of specialty. Because everything is designed, the number of areas is enormous,
                ranging from clothes and furniture to complex control rooms and bridges. This book covers everyday
                things,
                focusing on the interplay between technology and people to ensure that the products actually fulfill
                human
                needs while being understand- able and usable. In the best of cases, the products should also be
                delightful
                and enjoyable, which means that not only must the re- quirements of engineering, manufacturing, and
                ergonomics be sat- isfied, but attention must be paid to the entire experience, which means the
                aesthetics
                of form and the quality of interaction. The major areas of design relevant to this book are industrial
                design, interaction design, and experience design. None of the fields is well defined, but the focus of
                the
                efforts does vary, with industrial

                designers emphasizing form and material, interactive designers emphasizing understandability and
                usability,
                and experience de- signers emphasizing the emotional impact. Thus:

                Industrial design: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that
                optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user
                and
                manufacturer (from the Industrial Design Society of America’s website).

                Interaction design: The focus is upon how people interact with tech- nology. The goal is to enhance
                people’s
                understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction de- sign
                draws
                upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.

                Experience design: The practice of designing products, processes, ser- vices, events, and environments
                with
                a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience.

                Design is concerned with how things work, how they are con- trolled, and the nature of the interaction
                between people and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When
                done
                badly, the products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation. Or they might be usable,
                but
                force us to behave the way the product wishes rather than as we wish.
                Machines, after all, are conceived, designed, and constructed by people. By human standards, machines
                are
                pretty limited. They do not maintain the same kind of rich history of experiences that people have in
                common
                with one another, experiences that enable us to interact with others because of this shared
                understanding.
                Instead, machines usually follow rather simple, rigid rules of be- havior. If we get the rules wrong
                even
                slightly, the machine does what it is told, no matter how insensible and illogical. People are
                imaginative
                and creative, filled with common sense; that is, a lot of valuable knowledge built up over years of
                experience. But instead of capitalizing on these strengths, machines require us to be precise and
                accurate,
                things we are not very good at. Machines have no
