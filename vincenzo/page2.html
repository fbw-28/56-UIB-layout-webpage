                with a bewildering array of controls and displays, we simply mem- orize one or two fixed settings to
                approximate what is desired.
                In England I visited a home with a fancy new Italian washer- dryer combination, with super-duper
                multisymbol
                controls, all to do everything anyone could imagine doing with the washing and drying of clothes. The
                husband (an engineering psychologist) said he refused to go near it. The wife (a physician) said she had
                simply memorized one setting and tried to ignore the rest. I asked to see the manual: it was just as
                confusing as the device. The whole pur- pose of the design is lost.
